# My TODO App
My TODO App built with DOM manipulation - JavaScript | HTML


The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app is able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

To this is also added delete functionality which is in the form of a button within each TODO that removes that TODO
when clicked.
